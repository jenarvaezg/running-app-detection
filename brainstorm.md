## Sometimes I will suddenly think about a feature or a way to fix/improve something, don't mind this.

* Get radius of circle first so we can modify the way x and y is chosen in order to avoid having circle outside of canvas
* How can vibration be modeled in order to get a tap? A quick sucession of taps would surely generate a different pattern than a set of slow taps.
* Try to think about a way to tag more accurately the data. Right now we tag **after** the touch is performed. It would be interesting to see how a single tap affects the device's sensors (before during and after).
* Record a set of taps and plot them **(ipynotebook incoming)**
* ~~What about using cool sensors instead of just raw sensors? [Rotation vector](https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types.html#rotation_vector). This would fix the different sample rate problem.
[Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7JQ7Rpwn2k)~~. **Added rotation vector**
* ~~Change way the csv file is stored, save it to public storage instead of private.~~. **Y tho.**
* ~~Add an outline in order to be able to see the circle even if a black color is picked.~~
