## Sometimes I will suddenly think about a feature or a way to fix/improve something, don't mind this.

* Add some sort of arrows in order to make users swipe instead of only typing
* Determine the amount of before and after events to store in the CSV
* Maybe add another field to the CSV, so taps can be grouped together. Problem: want to aggregate events from different CSVs so incremental 0->len(taps) won't be any good. Maybe hashcode of the timestamp?
* Idea, generate some sort of detector which tells if sensors are just picking noise or if they are picking an ongoing touch event
