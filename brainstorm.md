## Sometimes I will suddenly think about a feature or a way to fix/improve something, don't mind this.

* Get classifications and add to csv
* Add some sort of arrows in order to make users swipe instead of only typing
* Grab events from  the list and dump them to csv
* Idea, generate some sort of detector which tells if sensors are just picking noise or if they are picking an ongoing touch event
* Store all events to csv file, but label them accordignly to what they are.
